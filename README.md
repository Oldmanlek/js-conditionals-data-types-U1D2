# Javascript Exercise: Conditionals and Data-Types

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository, then clone it onto your system.

2. Write your solution in `script.js`. Open `index.html` in your browser, which will run your code. Use your browser's console to examine any output where necessary. 

3. Complete as many of the following exercises as you can in 1 hour. Do prioritize the standard exercises over the bonus or extra ones. 

4. When you are done, practise using git by using `git add .` to stage your changes, then `git commit -m 'your message'` to commit your changes, and `git push` to push your changes up to your repo. Next, create and submit a pull request on github.com. That will be the method by which our homework exercises will be submitted.

## Exercise 1
Prompt the user for 2 numbers, then console.log their difference. For example, if the user gives the numbers 2 and 3, the result should be 1. If the user gives the numbers 3 and 2, the result should still
be 1.
_Hint: To get the user input and store it in a variable, we can do `var someVar = prompt("Give me a high five");`. Consider asking for 1 number at a time first._

## Exercise 2
Prompt the user for a number, then console.log its ordinal version. For example, if the user inputs 1, the result should be `"1st"`. If the user inputs 10, the result should be `"10th"`. If the user inputs 421, the result should be `"421st"`.
_Hint: There is a function that can return the character at a specified position in a string. Search Google / MDN for 'javascript string methods' if you need to._

## Exercise 3
Generate a random integer (hint: search Google or MDN) between 1 to 10. Prompt the user for an integer between 1 to 10, then let the user know whether his/her number matched the randomly generated one.

## Exercise 4
Generate a random string of length 6 alphanumeric characters. E.g. a result might be `"a5bxt1"`. Running it again might give `"2bhdr3"`.
_Hint: Pseudocode this first, possibly starting from the end result. What information do you need to construct the string? How would you get that information? Can you store fixed information in a convenient place first?_

__Bonus: Generate a random alphanumeric string of any specified length.__

## Exercise 5
Shuffle the elements of the given array below. E.g. running your code might produce `[4, 1, 16, 8, 128, 2, 32, 64]` once, and `[128, 1, 2, 64, 16, 4, 8, 32]` the next time.

`var testArray = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128];`

## Exercise 6
Examine the phonebook below.

1. Prompt the user for a name, and show (in any way, e.g. console.log) the phone number corresponding to the given name. 
2. Prompt the user for a name and a number. Update the number corresponding to the name if the name exists in the phonebook.
3. Prompt the user for a name and a number. If the name and number do not already exist in the phonebook, insert it into the phonebook.
4. Prompt the user for a name. If the name exists in the phonebook, erase its record.

__Bonus: Prompt the user for a number. If the number exists in the phonebook, show the name corresponding to it.__

_Hint: The phonebook is a JS Object. Search Google / MDN for 'Javascript Object methods' to see if there might be something useful._

```
var Phonebook = {
    "Jason"         :   91216599,
    "Amelie"        :   64239839,
    "Sing An"       :   85404834,
    "Ong Tng Kai"   :   94547788,
    "Nelson Tan"    :   63396565
};
```
